# NeuroMS

Description
This repository houses an open-source project dedicated to Multiple Sclerosis (MS) disease. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a complex, chronic disease affecting millions worldwide. Its diverse symptoms, ranging from fatigue and mobility issues to cognitive decline, have a profound impact on the quality of life and create significant economic burdens. The lack of a cure, coupled with the challenges of diagnosis, can lead to delays in treatment and increased uncertainty for patients. NeuroMS is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to revolutionize MS management. It leverages the power of AI to analyse medical history and MRI scans, facilitating faster and more accurate MS diagnosis. Additionally, NeuroMS provides tools for crucial MS assessments, including CIS evaluation, EDSS, SDMT, SNRS, and COMBIWISE. This integrated approach offers a more complete picture of a patient's status. Recognizing the social and emotional toll of MS, NeuroMS fosters a supportive online community. It provides forums, story sharing, support groups, and events, helping to combat the isolation that often accompanies the disease. NeuroMS aims to transform the MS landscape. By accelerating diagnosis, providing comprehensive assessments, and building a nurturing community, the platform seeks to improve the lives of people with MS while supporting ongoing research into this complex disease. 


Folder Structure
The repository is organized into the following folders:

1. Main Website Folder
The main_website folder contains the source code and assets for the main informative website. This section serves as a central hub for gathering and presenting detailed information about MS disease, its symptoms, treatments, research advancements, and related resources. Users can access this website to educate themselves about MS and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the field.

2. Model Deployment Folder
The model_deployment folder contains the deployment of various AI models specifically developed to aid in MS-related assessments and diagnoses. These models include:

Risk Assessment: An AI model that assesses the risk factors associated with MS development.
MS Diagnosis: An AI model that assists in diagnosing MS based on input data and medical parameters.
MS Type Detection: An AI model that helps determine the specific type of MS a patient may have.
CIS Diagnosis: An AI model that aids in diagnosing Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS), often considered an early symptom of MS.
EDSS: An AI model that evaluates the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) for MS patients, assessing their level of disability.
SDMT: An AI model that performs the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), a cognitive assessment tool used in MS diagnosis, and others like SNRS and CombiWise
MRI Segmentation: An AI model specialized in segmenting MRI images to aid in the analysis and diagnosis of MS.

3. Social Network Folder
The social_network folder contains the code for a dedicated web page that fosters community engagement among individuals affected by MS. This social network module provides a platform for patients, caregivers, and medical professionals to connect, share experiences, and support one another. It enables users to create profiles, join relevant groups, participate in discussions, and access valuable resources specific to MS.
