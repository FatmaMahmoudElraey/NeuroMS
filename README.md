# NeuroMS

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a complex, chronic disease affecting millions worldwide. Its diverse symptoms, ranging from fatigue and mobility issues to cognitive decline, have a profound impact on the quality of life and create significant economic burdens. The lack of a cure, coupled with the challenges of diagnosis, can lead to delays in treatment and increased uncertainty for patients. NeuroMS is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to revolutionize MS management. It leverages the power of AI to analyse medical history and MRI scans, facilitating faster and more accurate MS diagnosis. Additionally, NeuroMS provides tools for crucial MS assessments, including CIS evaluation, EDSS, SDMT, SNRS, and COMBIWISE. This integrated approach offers a more complete picture of a patient's status. Recognizing the social and emotional toll of MS, NeuroMS fosters a supportive online community. It provides forums, story sharing, support groups, and events, helping to combat the isolation that often accompanies the disease. NeuroMS aims to transform the MS landscape. By accelerating diagnosis, providing comprehensive assessments, and building a nurturing community, the platform seeks to improve the lives of people with MS while supporting ongoing research into this complex disease.
